## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**TTS not working:**
- Ensure pyttsx3 is installed: `pip install pyttsx3`
- Check system audio settings
- Try different speech rates

**Audio recording issues:**
- Verify microphone permissions
- Check PyAudio installation
- Ensure microphone is not in use by other applications

**API errors:**
- Verify Gemini API key in `.env` file
- Check internet connection
- Ensure API key has proper permissions

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Windows:**
- TTS uses Windows SAPI voices
- PyAudio may require Visual C++ redistributables

**macOS:**
- TTS uses macOS system voices
- May need to grant microphone permissions

**Linux:**
- TTS uses espeak or festival
- May need to install additional audio packages
